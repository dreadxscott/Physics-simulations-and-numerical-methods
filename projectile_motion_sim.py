"""
Hello, and welcome to the start of my program. I will be spending some time relearning physcs, but by implementing the things I learn in python code. I might eventually switch to C++ since it's faster, but for right nwo we'll go with this

I know I'll probably need to import a bunch of stuff, but that's part of the fun

For now, I'll import numpy, scikit-learn, pandas to do the calculations and such

I'm gonna run from mechanics, to electricity and magnetism, to waves, to quantum mechanics, to general relativity, and maybe one day I'll learn to implement stuff for QED or QFT. None of that string theory shit, that's not real science.

So to begin, we have to define basic position, velocity, acceleration, and projectile motion
